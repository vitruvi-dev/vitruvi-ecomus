A full charge with your diffuser plugged directly into the wall will take about 1-2 hours (exact charging times may vary). You can also charge your Move Diffuser by plugging in the charging pad and placing the diffuser on top. This method is great for quick battery top-ups and continual use. Once your diffuser is fully charged, the four lights at the back will stop blinking."

The first thing we suggest doing is checking with your vet—your animal may be more sensitive than others, so your vet will know best.\n\nStronger scents such as Lemon, Grapefruit, Peppermint, and Boost, should be used sparingly. If you would still like to diffuse one of these scents, I would suggest limiting the number of drops to approximately 1-5 drops.\n\nFrankincense, Lavender, and Cedarwood are great options to diffuse around animals. We also suggest turning your diffuser off when your animals are home alone, just in case they do become agitated by the scent."

When it comes to newborns, we recommend waiting 3 months before using essential oils. But your doctor will know best, as we all react differently. Always opt for essential oils that are 100% pure, vegan, cruelty-free, and free from synthetic fragrance.\n\nThese are the products we recommend starting with once you’ve spoken to your doctor: Lavender, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Lemon, Frankincense, Cedarwood, Boost, Sleep."
