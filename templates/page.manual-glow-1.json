If you would still like to diffuse one of these scents, I would suggest limiting the number of drops to approximately 1-5 drops.\n\nFrankincense, Lavender, and Cedarwood are great options to diffuse around animals. We also suggest turning your diffuser off when your animals are home alone, just in case they do become agitated by the scent.\n\nFor more information, visit our page here."

But your doctor will know best, as we all react differently.\nAlways opt for essential oils that are 100% pure, vegan, cruelty-free, and free from synthetic fragrance.\n\n\nThese are the products we recommend starting with once you’ve spoken to your doctor: Lavender, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Lemon, Frankincense, Cedarwood, Boost, Sleep."
