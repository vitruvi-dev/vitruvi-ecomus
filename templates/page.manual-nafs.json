In terms of household products, they are found in everything from paint and varnishes to aerosols and deodorants. Concentrations of VOCs are often higher indoors, which is why these are a common group of compounds to look out for in your products.\n\nWhen exposed to high levels of VOCs, some of the short-term health effects can include headaches, eye and throat irritation, nausea, and dizziness; long-term effects can include central nervous system damage and cancer."
