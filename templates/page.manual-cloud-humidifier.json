We recommend placing your humidifier on a flat, level surface to prevent leakage.\n\nAnother reason the humidifier is leaking could be due to water being poured directly into the base. If water is poured into the base and flows through the internal air vent, the device will leak. Always make sure that water is filled from the bucket instead of the base to prevent leaks.\n\nLastly, leakage may occur if the inner spring in the water bucket is stuck. You can locate the inner spring on the bottom of the water bucket. If this happens, gently use your fingers to loosen and free the spring.

If you then change the mist level, the humidifier will adjust its run time to accommodate that.\n\nAnother reason why your humidifier is not running the full cycle could be because there is not enough water in the bucket.

Alternatively, if there is a small amount of water in the bucket, the humidifier may in fact be misting, but there just isn’t enough water to create a visual mist.\n\nIn addition, if you haven’t cleaned your humidifier recently, we recommend giving it a deep clean to remove mineral buildup that could be preventing mist from emitting.
