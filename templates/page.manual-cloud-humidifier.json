If water is poured into the base and flows through the internal air vent, the device will leak. Always make sure that water is filled from the bucket instead of the base to prevent leaks.\n\nLastly, leakage may occur if the inner spring in the water bucket is stuck. You can locate the inner spring on the bottom of the water bucket. If this happens, gently use your fingers to loosen and free the spring.
