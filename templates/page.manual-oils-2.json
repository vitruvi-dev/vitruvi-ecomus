The first thing we suggest doing is checking with your vet—your animal may be more sensitive than others, so your vet will know best.\n\nStronger scents such as Lemon, Grapefruit, Peppermint, and Boost, should be used sparingly. If you would still like to diffuse one of these scents, I would suggest limiting the number of drops to approximately 1-5 drops.\n\nFrankincense, Lavender, and Cedarwood are great options to diffuse around animals. We also suggest turning your diffuser off when your animals are home alone, just in case they do become agitated by the scent.\n\nFor more information, visit our page here."

When it comes to newborns, we recommend waiting 3 months before using essential oils. But your doctor will know best, as we all react differently.\nAlways opt for essential oils that are 100% pure, vegan, cruelty-free, and free from synthetic fragrance.\n\n\nThese are the products we recommend starting with once you’ve spoken to your doctor: Lavender, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Lemon, Frankincense, Cedarwood, Boost, Sleep."

As a part of a built-in feature to protect our diffusers, the unit won’t run if the ultrasonic plates are clogged with essential oils. Watch our video above for instructions on how to clean your diffuser.\n\nNext, make sure the water is filled to just below the line inside the reservoir.
